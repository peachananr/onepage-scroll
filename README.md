## Compatibility
Modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both desktop and smartphones have been tested. Not tested on IE.

## Basic Usage
One Page Scroll let you transform your website into a one page scroll website that allows users to scroll one page at a time. It is perfect for creating a website in which you want to present something to the viewers. For example, [Apple's iPhone 5S website](http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/) uses the same technique.


To add this to your website, simply include the latest jQuery library together with `jquery.onepage-scroll.js`, `onepage-scroll.css` into your document's `<head>` and call the function as follows:

````html
<body>
  ...
  <div class="main">
    <section>...</section>
    <section>...</section>
    ...
  </div>
  ...
</body>
````
Container "Main" must be one level below the `body` tag in order to make it work full page. Now call the function to activate as follows:

````javascript
$(".main").onepage_scroll({
   sectionContainer: "section", // sectionContainer accepts any kind of selector in case you don't want to use section
   easing: "ease", // Easing options accepts the CSS3 easing animation such "ease", "linear", "ease-in", "ease-out", "ease-in-out", or even cubic bezier value such as "cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.420, 1.310)"
   animationTime: 1000, // AnimationTime let you define how long each section takes to animate
   pagination: true, // You can either show or hide the pagination. Toggle true for show, false for hide.
   updateURL: false, // Toggle this true if you want the URL to be updated automatically when the user scroll to each page.
   beforeMove: function(current_page_index[, next_page_index]) {}, // This option accepts a callback function. The function will be called before the page moves.
   afterMove: function(current_page_index) {}, // This option accepts a callback function. The function will be called after the page moves.
   loop: false, // You can have the page loop back to the top/bottom when the user navigates at up/down on the first/last page.
   direction: 'vertical', // You can control the direction of scroll and order of sections to be "vertical" or "horizontal",
   touchTarget: '.top-layer', // You can attach the touch events to another container, for example if using multiple z-index div's
   onLoad: function(current_page_index) {} // This option accepts a callback function. The function will be called when onepage-scroll is loaded
});
````
And that's it. Now, your website should work the same way Apple's iPhone 5S website does. You should be able to swipe up/down as well (thanks to [Eike Send](https://github.com/eikes) for his swipe events!) when viewing your website on mobile phones.

## Public Methods
You can also trigger page move programmatically as well:

### $.fn.moveUp(increment)
This method allows you to move the page up by one. This action is equivalent to scrolling up/swiping down. The `increment` variable is an option which allows the moving of the page up by the given increment.

````javascript
  $(".main").moveUp();
````

### $.fn.moveDown(increment)
This method allows you to move the page down by one. This action is equivalent to scrolling down/swiping up. The `increment` variable is an option which allows the moving of the page down by the given increment.


````javascript
  $(".main").moveDown();
````

### $.fn.moveTo(slide_index)
This method allows you to move to a chosen page index. The `slide_index` variable is the destination page index.


````javascript
  $(".main").moveTo(3);
````


## Callbacks
You can use callbacks to perform actions before or after the page move.

### beforeMove(current_page_index[, next_page_index ])
This callback gets called before the plugin performs its move.

````javascript
  $(".main").onepage_scroll({
    beforeMove: function(current_page_index) {
      ...
    }
  });
````

### afterMove(current_page_index)
This callback gets called after the move animation was performed.

````javascript
  $(".main").onepage_scroll({
    afterMove: function(current_page_index) {
      ...
    }
  });
````

### onLoad(current_page_index)
This callback gets called as soon as onepage-scroll is initially loaded

````javascript
  $(document).ready(function(){
    $(".main").onepage_scroll({
      sectionContainer: "section",
      onLoad: function(current_page_index) {
        // do something on load
      }
    });
  });
````
